                <p>
                    Dupetoolkit is malware. More specifically, it is a RAT and InfoStealer.<br /><br />
                    A RAT or a "Remote Access Trojan" (or "Remote Administration Tool") is a type of software that lets
                    someone browser and control your computer remotely. This means they can control your mouse, open
                    your files, look at your passwords, etc.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    An InfoStealer is a type of software that grabs as much of your account information as possible.
                    This can be done by grabbing your saved passwords from your browser, and also your Cookies, which
                    contain "session tokens." A session token is like a temporary password to access a website. If
                    anyone has your session tokens, they can access your account and pretend to be you, steal your game
                    items, and even steal money via payment providers (online banking, PayPal, etc.).
                </p>

                    <b>NOTE</b>: Some antiviruses have started detecting the mod's virus and cleaning it up. This
                    currently does <b>not</b> fully remove it, but it may in the future. Kaspersky Free is particularly
                    good at dealing with this one.

                    <li>Open task manager via Control + Shift + Escape</li>

                    <li>
                        Locate the search bar at the top, then search up "Windows PowerShell" and "CMD". If any of these
                        show up, right click the item and press end task.
                    </li>

                        There will be one or multiple .exe files in this folder, named something random like
                        "128ajds372.exe" Their icons will look like a command console ("C:/" on a black screen). Delete
                        these exe files.

                    <li>
                        Download Microsoft's "Autoruns" program. This is a program to see what is starting up with your
                        computer:

                    </li>
                    <li>When downloaded, right click on "autoruns64.exe" and select "Run as Administrator."</li>
                    <li>
                        Under the "Scheduled Tasks" tab, you might see those exe files you deleted earlier (they may be
                        marked in red or yellow). Delete these by clicking on them and pressing DEL or right clicking
                        them and selected "Delete."
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Change all of your passwords on another device. Even though I believe these are all of the steps to
                    remove this virus, it has already stolen your info and there is a chance it may still be lurking
                    somewhere on your machine. So, make sure you change your passwords, and to be extra safe, change
                    them on another device.

                    Downloading random mods off of the internet is still not recommended. Malware comes in many forms.
                    Many mods that have malware still maintain functionality, but also run malicious background
                    processes without you knowing.

                <p>
                    Mods from Curseforge or Modrinth often contain safe mods, particularly the latter. Mods that have
                    malware are able to get full access of your computer (Jar files are essentially .exe files).
                </p>
                <p>Always proceed with caution while trying mods.</p>
